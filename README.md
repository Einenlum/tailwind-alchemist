- **Replace existing colors** with new ones while maintaining consistency.

...then **Tailwind Alchemist** is for you ðŸª„

---

## Installation

No need to install it, you can run it with `npx`.

## Usage

All commands require at least one option `-p` or `--pattern` to know where to look for.

- Example with one pattern: `-p 'resources/views/**'`
- Example with multiple patterns: `-p 'resources/views/**' -p 'my/other/folder/**'`

### Scan for Tailwind Default Colors

To scan your project for Tailwind default colors:

```bash
npx tw-alchemist scan -p 'resources/views/**' -p 'some/other/folder/**'
```

Options:

- `-v`: Display the files where the colors are found.

```bash
npx tw-alchemist scan -p 'resources/views/**' -v
```

- `-vv`: Display the files and matches where the colors are found.

```bash
npx tw-alchemist scan -p 'resources/views/**' -vv
```

### Scan for a specific color (even a custom one)

```bash
npx tw-alchemist scan indigo-800 -p 'resources/views/**' -vv
```

### Replace Colors

To replace an existing color with another one:

```bash
npx tw-alchemist replace oldColor newColor -p 'resources/views/**'
```

To check what would be done without touching files, use `--dry-run`:

```bash
npx tw-alchemist replace oldColor newColor -p 'resources/views/**' --dry-run
```

Notes:

- If `newColor` doesnâ€™t exist in your Tailwind config, the tool will print the necessary CSS for you to add.
- If `oldColor` is one of Tailwindâ€™s default colors, the tool will use its **OKLCH value** for accurate replacement.
